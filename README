SYNOPSIS
    ./unplus-maildir [-nh] MAILDIR

DESCRIPTION
    The Maildir+ directory layout (as used by Dovecot) keeps subfolders
    in a path such as:

        ~/Maildir/.foo.bar.baz.blah

    The Maildir directory layout (as used by Kmail/Akonadi) keeps
    subfolders in a path such as:

        ~/.Maildir.directory/.foo.directory/.bar.directory/.baz.directory/blah

    This script runs on a Maildir+ directory (specified by MAILDIR)
    and re-arranges the subfolders to follow a Maildir directory layout.

    No files are added, removed, or changed. This script just renames
    directories.

          execute them.
